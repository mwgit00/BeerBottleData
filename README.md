# BeerBottleData

This repo has pictures of brown beer bottles.  So if you want to try to train some kind of brown beer bottle classifier, here is some data for you.  I've never had any good beer come out of a green or clear beer bottle so those colors have been omitted on purpose.

I made a light box with a "green screen" background for photographing the bottles.  Data Set 1 has some images that are slightly blurry.  I think I accidentally selected the wrong focus mode for those pictures.  So I did a reshoot with the same set of beer bottles.  That's why there's Data Set 1 and Data Set 1 Reshoot.  I also don't know how effective my attempt at making a green screen will be for extracting just the bottle from the image.  Hopefully there are enough good shots to make the data useful.

I used my phone to take the pictures.  The JPG images have some metadata with the camera settings.  They may vary from picture to picture.

I have more bottles and will try to take pictures of them as time permits.  The photos are stored at full resolution and eat up a lot of space.  If the repo gets too big, I may delete the first Data Set 1 with the blurry images.
